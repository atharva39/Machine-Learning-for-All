#### Question 1:  
In this quiz, I would like you to find out about a particular type of feature used in machine learning. That feature is called "bag of words". 

Use the internet to research the "bag of words" Representation and then answer the following questions. A simple web search should reveal some useful information. If you don't know the answer to any question, feel free to go back and do some more research before finished the quiz. 

Firstly, what type of data does "bag of words" represent?

- [ ] Images
- [ ] Speech audio
- [ ] Music
- [x] Written Text

#### Question 2:  
The bag of words representation ignores the order of the words in a text

- [x] True
- [ ] False

#### Question 3:  
The bag of words representation ignores the number of times a word appears in a text

- [ ] True
- [x] False

#### Question 4:  
How many numbers are used to represent a piece of text

- [x] One for every unique word (i.e. not including repeats)
- [ ] One for every character (letter) in the language
- [ ] One for every word in a text (the same as the word count)

#### Question 5:  
What do you think are the advantages and disadvantages of bag of words?

**Answers:**  
Advantages of Bag of Words (BoW):
One of the main advantages of the Bag of Words model is its simplicity and ease of implementation. It's a straightforward technique that is easy to understand and apply to a variety of text-based tasks like text classification or sentiment analysis. Additionally, BoW works efficiently with small to medium-sized datasets, providing a clear, numerical representation of text data that can be easily processed by machine learning algorithms.
Disadvantages of Bag of Words (BoW):
However, BoW has several limitations. First, it completely ignores the order of words and the context in which they appear, which can lead to a loss of important semantic meaning. For example, "cat sat on the mat" and "mat sat on the cat" would be treated as the same, even though their meanings are different. Another disadvantage is that BoW can lead to high-dimensional and sparse feature vectors, especially when dealing with large vocabularies. This can result in increased computational cost and less efficient processing.
