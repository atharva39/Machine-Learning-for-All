#### Question 1:  
Modern deep neural networks work well because:

- [x] They can scale up to very large amounts of data
- [ ] They use very complex, sophisticated algorithms
- [ ] They use input data that is in a very sophisticated, high level, feature representation.
- [ ] They are based on clear, logical rules that are designed based on expert knowledge

#### Question 2:  
What is the output of a regression?

One of a set of categories
- [ ] A picture
- [ ] A reward or punishment
- [x] One or more numbers

#### Question 3:  
The feature representation you use has no effect in k-nearest neighbour because it is based on similarity?

- [ ] True
- [x] False

#### Question 4:  
Which of these is true?

- [ ] If you are using high level features you will need more training data than if you are using low level features
- [x] If you are using low level features you will need more training data than if you are using high level features
- [ ] The features do not affect how much data you need

#### Question 5:  
Which do you typically think need more disc space?

- [ ] High level features
- [x] Low level features
