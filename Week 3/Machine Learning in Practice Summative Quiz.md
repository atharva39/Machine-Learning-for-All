#### Question 1:  
Why is Google very successful at Machine Learning?

- [x] They have more data than other companies
- [ ] They have better algorithms

#### Question 2:  
In machine learning, your testing set should be:

- [ ] The same as your entire training set
- [ ] As different as possible from your training set
- [x] Examples that are not in your training set but similar to the examples in your training set
- [ ] A small selection of examples from your training set

#### Question 3:  
Neural networks risk being "Weapons of Math Destruction" because...

- [x] They can be hard to understand
- [ ] They don't work very well
- [ ] They are biased against women
- [ ] They work on low level data features

#### Question 4:  
Why is it important to keep testing and training sets separate?

- [ ] They need to use different data features
- [x] The algorithm might learn irrelevant features in the training set
- [ ] It makes training faster
- [ ] Machine learning algorithms can't handle too much data, so you might as well save the rest for testing

#### Question 5:  
What is the best way of eliminating bias in machine learning?

- [ ] develop better algorithms
- [x] Have as many diverse people as possible involved in collecting data and training machine learning
algorithms
