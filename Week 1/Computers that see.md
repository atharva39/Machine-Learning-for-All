Question 1  
What do you think it is about computer vision that makes it hard for computers? How are they different from people? How could computers learn to see in the same way as people?
Write a short answer to these questions based on what you already know, so that you can start thinking about the issues we will cover in this course.

**Answer:**  
Computer vision is difficult for computers because they lack the natural context and pattern recognition abilities humans have. While people intuitively understand images, computers need structured data and extensive training to interpret visual information. Mimicking human vision requires advanced algorithms and large datasets for accurate perception.
